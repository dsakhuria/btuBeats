you will have to install required deps to make the sourcecode work without errors: 

- make sure u have python installed(so u can use pip)
- install deps using pip

*pip install discord | pip install yt-dlp | pip install pynacl | pip install ffmpeg (same with other frameworks)


bot uses yt_dlp as main source for youtube api, also make sure to have ffmpeg installed.

installing ffmpeg: 

1. pip install ffmpeg 
2. download folder directly from ffmpeg official webpage
3. put folder inside ur bot root folder
4. [!] make sure u add ffmpeg main directory to Enviromental PATH.
5. if not allowed by default,enable ffmpeg as an audio output streaming tool
